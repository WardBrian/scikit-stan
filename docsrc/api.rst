API Reference
=============

Here is a documentation of the public API of sk Stan regression. This will remain stable between versions, with the proimse of backwards compatibility between minor versions and ample warnings prior to large changes to the API. 

This package also has an `internal API <internal_api.html>`__, which is not stable and is not meant to be used by users, but contains useful functions
for developers seeking to add additional models or improve existing models.
